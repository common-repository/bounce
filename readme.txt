Bounce plugin finds and manage bounced email address for newsletter, notification and mailing plugins

== Description ==

Bounce plugin uses a (provided) POP3 to look for delivery error messages (bounced
emails) and tries to remove them from your blog so no more emails will be sent to those
not working addressed. It's a good practice to avoid to be marked as "spammer".

Developer contributions welcomed.
